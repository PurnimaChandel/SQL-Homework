#1a. Display the first and last names of all actors from the table actor.
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR;

SELECT UPPER(CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, " ", LAST_NAME)) AS ACTOR_NAME
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR;

#2a. You need to find the ID number, first name, and last name of an actor, of whom you know only the first name, "Joe." What is one query would you use to obtain this information?
SELECT ACTOR_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR
WHERE FIRST_NAME = "JOE";

#2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters GEN:
SELECT ACTOR_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE "%GEN%";

#2c. Find all actors whose last names contain the letters LI. This time, order the rows by last name and first name, in that order:
SELECT  LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE "%LI%";

#2d. Using IN, display the country_id and country columns of the following countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and China
SELECT * FROM SAKILA.COUNTRY
WHERE COUNTRY IN ('Afghanistan', 'Bangladesh', 'China');

#3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, so create a column in the table actor named description and use the data type BLOB (Make sure to research the type BLOB, as the difference between it and VARCHAR are significant).
ALTER TABLE SAKILA.ACTOR
ADD DESCRIPTION BLOB;
#3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the description column.
ALTER TABLE SAKILA.ACTOR
DROP COLUMN DESCRIPTION;

#4a. List the last names of actors, as well as how many actors have that last name.
SELECT LAST_NAME, COUNT(LAST_NAME) AS COUNT
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR
GROUP BY LAST_NAME;

SELECT LAST_NAME, COUNT(LAST_NAME) AS COUNT
FROM SAKILA.ACTOR
GROUP BY LAST_NAME
HAVING COUNT >1;

UPDATE SAKILA.ACTOR
SET FIRST_NAME = "HARPO"
WHERE FIRST_NAME = "GROUCHO"
AND LAST_NAME = "WILLIAMS";

#4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing GROUCHO to HARPO. It turns out that GROUCHO was the correct name after all! In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently HARPO, change it to GROUCHO.
UPDATE SAKILA.ACTOR
SET FIRST_NAME = "GROUCHO"
WHERE FIRST_NAME = "HARPO";

#5a. You cannot locate the schema of the address table. Which query would you use to re-create it?
SHOW CREATE TABLE SAKILA.ADDRESS;

GROUP BY STAFF.STAFF_ID;

#6b. Use JOIN to display the total amount rung up by each staff member in August of 2005. Use tables staff and payment.
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SUM(AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT

ON STAFF.STAFF_ID = PAYMENT.STAFF_ID
WHERE PAYMENT_DATE LIKE "2005-08-%"
GROUP BY STAFF.STAFF_ID;

#6c. List each film and the number of actors who are listed for that film. Use tables film_actor and film. Use inner join.

GROUP BY FILM.TITLE;
#6d. How many copies of the film Hunchback Impossible exist in the inventory system?

FROM SAKILA.CUSTOMER
LEFT JOIN SAKILA.PAYMENT
ON CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID = PAYMENT.CUSTOMER_ID
GROUP BY CUSTOMER.CUSTOMER_ID
ORDER BY CUSTOMER.LAST_NAME;

#7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters K and Q have also soared in popularity. Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters K and Q whose language is English.
